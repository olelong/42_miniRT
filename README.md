# 42_miniRT

### The objective of the program is to model images according to the raytracing protocol.

These images must represent a scene, seen from a defined angle and containing simple 
geometrical objects, each with objects, each with its own lighting system.

This project uses the MinilibX, the goal was to implement at least 3 simple geometric 
objects such as plane, sphere, Cylinder and to be able to apply transformations to objects,
lights and camera: translation and rotation.


### An example of a simple scene with multi-objects:

![origin](./img/origin.png)

### How does it works :
